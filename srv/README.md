# Discord.js-Bad-Words - Mute/Warn for harmful/malicious words

Automatically delete messages that contain bad links and permanently mute the user for doing so.

In here you will find the raw source code for Bad-Words for you to merge with your current code.

Like the standalone bot, I recommend placing the BadLinks stuff in a seperate automod folder to keep it organized. Alternatively it will work if you chuck it all in the index.js file.

You will need to define your *own* words to delete/mute for within the 3 badWords json files.

This code was last tested & working with `discord.js v13.6.0` & `node.js v16.13.0`

If  you have any issues with this code working, feel free to open an issue and I will try and help as much as I can.
