# Discord.js-Bad-Words
Bad Words automod. Punish users for saying set words

This code was last tested & working with `discord.js v13.6.0` & `node.js v13.13.0`

Discord.js Bad Words can either run as a standalone bot or it can be merged into your existing code.

See **/standalone-bot/** for the code to run Bad-Words as a standalone discord.js bot.

See **/srv/** for the source code to merge with your current bot.

If you come across any issues, bugs or errors while setting up the code open an Issue and I will be happy to help.
